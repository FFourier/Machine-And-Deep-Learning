## Basic Machine Learning implementations

#### Instructions:

The folder **notebooks** has all files related to the writing of code stored in *Open Algorithms* and *Classic-Methods* folders.

In **Open Algorithms** there is a compact version of code related to maths inherent to different concepts. This is not a formal or extrict rightful aproximation, but it's a mode to superficially understand those concepts. 

In **Classic-Methods** there are several implementatios of libraries.
